Local copy in repository folder **UCI HAR Dataset**

Please refer to **./UCI HAR Dataset/README.md** for original data description.

## Target clean data
Contains averages of *mean()* and *std()* values grouped by activity and subject. Stored in **cleanData.txt**

## Cleaning Steps

1. Load feature mapping from **UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt**
2. Trim it by only keeping features containing *std()* and *mean()* in their names
3. Load activity mapping from **./UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt**
4. Load points from train set **./UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt**
5. Load points from train set **./UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt**
6. Concatenate rows using *rbind(...)* function
7. Filter based on trimmed features
8. Load subject IDs from train set **./UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt**
9. Load subject IDs from train set **./UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt**
10. Concatenate rows using *rbind(...)* function
11. Load activity IDs from train set **./UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt**
12. Load activity IDs from train set **./UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt**
13. Concatenate rows using *rbind(...)* function
14. Convert IDs to descriptive activity names from activity map
13. Concatenate activity, subject and points data using *cbind(...)* function
14. Generate descriptive labels and attach them to data table
15. Prepare data.table package (will install if does not already included)
16. Convert data.frame to data.table (for next steps)
17. Extract means grouped by activity and subject 
18. Sort result by activity and subject 
19. Record resulting clean data set to a file **./cleanData.txt**
20. Return an in-memory copy for potential processing
